# simple-open-auction
The general idea of the following simple auction contract is that everyone can send their bids during a bidding period. The bids already include sending some compensation, e.g. Ether, in order to bind the bidders to their bid. If the highest bid is raised, the previous highest bidder gets their Ether back.
